        <h4>Zesty Lore:</h4>
        <p>These shortbread crust lemon bars are one of my favorite 
            cookies of all time â€” although technically, they're closer 
            to a pie than a cookie. Nothing prepares you for that intense, 
            awesome sweet and tart lemon-flavored custard, perfectly contrasted 
            against crisp, sweet, buttery shortbread cookie.</p>
        <h4>Shortbread Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter at room temperature</li>
            <li>1/4 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Lemon Custard Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated lemon zest</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>How To Make:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Set an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 
                350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x8-inch baking 
                dish.</li>
            <li>Make crust: Use the back of a spatula or wooden spoon to mash flour 
                and butter in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Mix in confectioners' 
                sugar, vanilla, and salt until mixture resembles slightly crumbly cookie dough. 
                Moisten your fingers with a little water and press dough into the bottom of the 
                prepared baking dish. Use a fork to prick holes all over crust.</li>
            <li>Bake on the middle rack in the preheated oven until edges are barely golden brown, 
                about 22 minutes. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Make custard: Beat together eggs and egg yolks in a medium bowl until combined. 
                Whisk in white sugar and flour until smooth. Add lemon juice and zest; whisk for 
                2 minutes. Pour over warm crust.</li>
            <li>Bake on the center rack until custard is set and the top has a thin white sugary 
                crust, about 25 minutes. Let cool completely before cutting into bars.</li>
            <li>Dip a knife into very hot water, then run the blade around the edges and cut 
                into 16 squares. Dust bars with confectioners' sugar.</li>
        </ol>
